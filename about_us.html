		<h1>About Us:</h1>
		<h2>Who we are: </h2>
		<p>For nearly two decades, TrueCar has enabled consumers to connect with Certified Dealers to engage in buying and selling automotive transactions. We are the first and only online marketplace for new, used and certified pre-owned vehicles. We provide consumers with the research and shopping tools they need to confidently purchase or lease a vehicle that fits their life. In partnership with our network of Certified Dealers, we offer one of the most expansive inventories. </p>
		<p>Now, TrueCar is building a modern-day marketplace to make car buying and selling more easy, convenient and transparent, and bringing more of the transaction online. We are designing a shopping experience customized to individual preferences. There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution when it comes to purchasing a car. Whether your budget is $6,000 or $60,000, or if it’s your first time buying a car or 14th time, TrueCar makes car buying true for you.</p>
